# Introduction to AWS

Notes from the Skillbuilder section of AWS - notes written are either important of stuff I need to learn. Some obvious
stuff may be omitted

## Client Server Model

* Client can be a web browser or desktop application - that makes requests to computer servers.
* Server can be services - such as EC2

Important aspect of cloud
* Cloud benefit You only pay for what you use 
* On-prem all your resources are on standby even when not in use 

## Cloud Computing

Takes the management and maintenance of your compute and db away, so you can focus on the development of the app itself.
 * Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT


## Hybrid Deployment
* Connect cloud-based resources to on-prem infrastructure
* Integrate cloud based resources with legacy IT Apps
Used when apps are better maintained on prem - or due to government regulations. 

# Benefits of cloud computing
* Trade upfront expense for lower variable expense
* Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
* Stop guessing capacity
* Massive economies of scale 
* Increase speed and agility
  * flexibility makes it easier to develop and deploy apps
  * new ec2 instances can be created instantly
* Global in minutes
