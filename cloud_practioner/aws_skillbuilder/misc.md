# EC2
* Types of EC2 instances 
  * General Purpose - Web servers or code repos, small medium dbs
  * Compute Optimised - Compute intensive tasks - like gaming servers - Scientific modelling or RT processing, batch
  * Memory Optimised - large datasets in memory - high ram - large data to be preloaded before running for RT processing
  * Accelerated Computing - Floating point number calculations - Graphics processing - Utilise hardware accelerators
  * Storage Optimised - high sequential read and write access to large db on local storage - fast IO - DW

* EC2 pricing has on demand and savings plan (which saves up to 72%)
  * Also applies to lambda and fargate
  * On-demand, savings, dedicated host (single tenancy), reserved instances, spot instances  
  * Dedicated hosts retain software license 

# Storage and DBs
* EBS is AZ only and on the same AZ as EC2 - EFS is regional 
* Redshift ML trains ML modeuls using SQL commands and utilise the trained model in DW for data forecasting

# IAM
temp permissions - look for roles - not policies or groups
prohibited actions are listed in the acceptable use documentation by aws
