## Cloud Adoption Framework CAF

Six core perspectives of the Cloud Adoption Framework

At the highest level, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called Perspectives.

Each Perspective addresses distinct responsibilities. The planning process helps the right people across
the organization prepare for the changes ahead.

In general, the Business, People, and Governance Perspectives focus on business capabilities, 
whereas the Platform, Security, and Operations Perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

To learn more about the AWS CAF, expand each of the following six categories.

* Business

* Platform
  * Cloud Architect
* Security

# Migration Strategies
THere are 6 strategies when it comes to your enterprise migration. - 6 Rs

* Rehosting - Lift and Shift - easier to optimise once already in cloud 
* Replatforming - Lift, tinker and shift - a few cloud optimisations and tweaks but nothing major and no new dev effort 
  * e.g. mysql to RDS mysql or aurora 
* Retire - Some parts no longer needed when on cloud
* Retain - some about to be deprecated - so no reason to move to AWS 
* Repurchase - moving from a traditional license to a software as a service model - always a new product 
* Refactoring - driven by business to add features and optimise - highest initial human effort
